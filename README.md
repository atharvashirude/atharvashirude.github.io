## What is This?

A web-based security engineer profile with a twist—
there’s an integrated web terminal, autocomplete, and fun “easter egg” commands.
Test your hacker cred, poke around, or just enjoy the UI.

## Terminal Features

- **Tab autocomplete**
- Command output mimics a real shell
- Enter `help` for a list of available commands
- Type `quote` for inspiration
- Try `sudo` for the mystery

---

## Projects & Themes

- AI, security automation, LLM red teaming, honeypots.
- Playful modal animations and hacker vibes.
- No actual vulnerabilities—just awesome web craft.
